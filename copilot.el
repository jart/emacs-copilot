;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The `copilot-complete' function demonstrates that ~100 lines of LISP
;; is all it takes for Emacs to do that thing Github Copilot and VSCode
;; are famous for doing except superior w.r.t. both quality and freedom
;;
;; Emacs Copilot helps you do pair programming with a local-running LLM
;; that generates code completions within Emacs buffers. The LLM is run
;; as a sub-command that remembers your local editing history on a file
;; by file basis. Tokens stream into your buffer without delay as gen'd
;; and you can hit `C-g' to interrupt your LLM at any time. History and
;; memory can also be deleted from the LLM's context when deleting code
;; from your Emacs buffer that matches up verbatim. Copilot is language
;; agnostic and your programming language is determed by file extension
;;
;; The recommended LLM right now is WizardCoder 34b since it scores the
;; same as GPT-4 on HumanEval. You need a computer like a Mac Studio M2
;; Ultra in order to use it. If you have a modest system then you could
;; consider downloading the WizardCoder-Python-13b llamafile since it's
;; almost as good, and will even go acceptably fast on CPU-only systems
;; having at least AVX2 and 2200 MT/s RAM. If you're even more strapped
;; for compute and use things like Raspberry Pi, then give Phi-2 a spin
;;
;; To get started, try writing the first line of a function, e.g.
;;
;;     bool is_prime(int x) {
;;
;; Then place your caret at the end of the line, and press `C-c C-k` to
;; hand over control to your LLM, which should generate the rest of the
;; function implementation for you. Things are also tuned so the LLM is
;; likely to stop as soon as a function is made. Explanations and other
;; kind of ELI5 commentary is avoided too.
;;
;; Later on, if you were to write something like this:
;;
;;     int main() {
;;       for (int i = 0; i < 100;
;;
;; And ask your LLM to complete that, then your LLM will likely recall
;; that you two wrote an is_prime() function earlier, even though it's
;; only considering those two lines in the current instruction. You'll
;; most likely then see it decide to generate code to print the primes
